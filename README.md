## Description
This is the results from our group project for UC Berekley Bootcamp. The requirements were: must use at least two server-side APIs, must use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap, must use client-side storage, polished UI and mobile friendly, good quality coding standards, does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts, must be deployed on GitHub Pages, must be interactive.

## Concept
The concept of the project is to provide options for bored individuals, similar to pulling out a box of activities in a cozy living room. Put your feet up, sit by the fireplace, and choose between reading a random book on the Gutenberg Project, test your trivia skills, or laugh at random jokes - all with just the click of a button. 

## Features
The Living Room utilizes three unique server-side APIs. The first uses Gutendex which is a JSON web API for Project Gutenberg, a library of over 60,000 free eBooks. The second is Open Trivia DB, a trivia API. Last is (), a joke API.
